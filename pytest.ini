; The -x option tells pytest to stop running tests after the first failure. This is useful for quickly identifying and fixing errors, especially in large test suites.
; The --tb=short option sets the traceback style to "short," which means that when a test fails, pytest will display a concise summary of the error rather than a full, detailed traceback. This helps keep the output readable and focused.
; The -q option stands for "quiet" mode, reducing the amount of output pytest produces. It hides extra information and only shows essential details, making it easier to spot failures.
