# Potential Terminologies

## The Joint Commission's RCA framework

- "Framework For Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Actions": A guide published by The Joint Commission, it outlines the steps and analysis questions for conducting a comprehensive RCA. It helps organizations investigate events, identify root causes, and organize corrective actions.
- "Root Cause Analysis in Health Care: A Joint Commission Guide": A comprehensive publication from the Joint Commission Resources (JCR) division that offers detailed guidance, tools, and examples for performing RCAs on sentinel and adverse events.
- Sentinel Event Policy and Procedures: The policy defines what constitutes a sentinel event and strongly encourages accredited organizations to conduct an RCA to learn from and prevent future occurrences. 

## Patient safety event taxonomy

- "The JCAHO patient safety event taxonomy": An article published in the International Journal for Quality in Health Care (2005) that details the taxonomy created by The Joint Commission to standardize terminology for patient safety incidents. The taxonomy includes five primary classifications: impact, type, domain, cause, and prevention or mitigation.
- National Quality Forum (NQF) Standardizing a Patient Safety Taxonomy: This 2006 report endorsed The Joint Commission's taxonomy and presented consensus standards to support its application.
- World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS): A global framework published in 2009 that defines and organizes patient safety concepts into 10 high-level classes, including "contributing factors/hazards". 

## Common healthcare industry parlance
This terminology can be found across several authoritative sources:

- AHRQ Patient Safety Network (PSNet) Glossary: A comprehensive online resource that provides definitions for common patient safety terms, including adverse events, near misses, and errors.
- Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Glossary of Terms: The IHI publishes numerous toolkits and guidance documents with glossaries defining key patient safety concepts, such as "safety culture" and "total systems safety".
- National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) Terminology: Although the NPSF has since merged with IHI, its foundational work defined many key terms like "just culture" and provided standard definitions that are still referenced by other organizations.
- The "Swiss Cheese Model": Developed by James Reason, this conceptual model is a widely cited framework for understanding how systemic failures lead to errors. It is a foundational concept in healthcare patient safety training.
