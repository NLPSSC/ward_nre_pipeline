A 72-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis presents with acute exacerbation of dyspnea and productive cough with yellowish sputum for the past 3 days.

The patient reports increased fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and occasional wheezing. She denies chest pain but admits to mild ankle swelling. Current medications include albuterol inhaler, tiotropium, and low-dose aspirin.

Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally with expiratory wheezes. The patient appears to be in mild respiratory distress with accessory muscle use.

Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation consistent with COPD and possible pneumonia in the right lower lobe. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia with pH 7.35, PCO2 48 mmHg, and PO2 68 mmHg on room air.

The patient was treated with nebulized bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia. Oxygen therapy was initiated to maintain saturation above 90%.

The patient showed improvement over the next 48 hours with decreased dyspnea and improved oxygenation. She was discharged with oral antibiotics and instructions for pulmonary rehabilitation.
