From the Boston, Medical and Surgical Journal, February 27, 1839.
Vol, 20, No. 3.
The Publishing Committee are happy in having an opportunity to en-
rich the first number of their Journal with the following article from the
pen of Dr. Flagg, on the subject of the Dental Ligament, which has been
a topic of some discussion, of late, in the newspapers and magazines of
the day. In the hands of a writer, distinguished alike for his professional
skill and intellectual attainments, and every way qualified to investigate
the question of the existence of such a ligament, the subject has been
carefully examined, and> we think, satisfactorily put at rest. At any rate,
the pages of this Journal will be always open to a temperate discussion
of this, and every other topic connected with the usefulness of our
profession.
ANATOMICAL DISCOVERY?THE LIGAMENTUM DENTIS.
To the Editor of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal,
Dear Sir.?I have been somewhat inclined to address you on this matter
of the new ligament, before this, as it has made much stir in Philadelphia
for these three or four months past; yet on reflection I could not but view
it as of too ridiculous a character to deserve serious comment in a scien-
tific journal. But I have been in error : and the subject has been public-
AMERICAN JOURNAL 19
ly introduced in the American Journal of Medical Science, by a very re-
spectable teacher of anatomy?Dr. P. G-oddard, of Philadelphia. It is
therefore, now a subject not to be passed over in silence, by those who
are seeking for truth, and who are willing that the whole truth, and noth-
ing but the truth, should be told.
While on a visit to Philadelphia, in October, I heard much of the skill
of a certain dentist?a Mr. Caldwell?who extracted teeth without giving
pain, or causing so little that it was not worth considering ; that he re-
moved them from the Jaw with much less effort than is usually requisite,
commonly with his fingers, using no instrument but a lancet or penknife
to loosen the toolli, which he did by cutting a previously unknown ligament
that he had discovered, and which he declared to be the main bond of
attachment between the teeth and jaw, and the principal obstruction to
their removal from their bony sockets.
I treated the matter as one of the thousand that are devised to gull the
public, who are generally ignorant of the truth in regard to such things.
I found myself, however, so much opposed by several friends who had
heard of the dentist and his discovery, and who stated many cases which
had been related to them of facts, that I was determined to see Mr. Cald-
well, and be informed from the only source whence I could expect to be
fully satisfied.
I saw Mr. C., and after spending about an hour with him, endeavoring
to get definite answers to my questions, which were mostly replied to by
asking me others, or reading to me portions of manuscript which he had
written on the subject, but which appeared to me to have no bearing on
the question of the ligament, I was obliged to leave him with much the
same impression that I had entertained previous to my call.
Although Mr. C. received me with great civility, and allowed me to ask
any question that I wished, he was apparently unwilling to answer them
till he had stated the views of several writers with regard to the articula-
tions of the teeth, and the anatomy of the parts connected with them, and
requested to know my views concerning certain conflicting opinions.
This seemed to me to be done for the purpose of discovering whether he
was dealing with one who had any definite or exact knowledge on the
subject ; for, as we approached it more nearly, and I had obtained all
the explanation I was likely to get, and said to him, "then it seems you
have not any new organ or part to demonstrate which has not been known
to us before, and described by those who have written on the subject,
and the parts which we call fibrous membrane and gum, or periosteum
and gum, you call ligament"?his teply was something like this u "Why,
sir, you know the names of parts depend on the fancy of those who give
them." This appeared to me like grasping at a more slender hold, and
very much like what is vulgarly called backing out. Our conversation
ended here, but as I was leaving the room, Mr. C. said, the part which I
call the ligament is situated between the teeth, only, and it is there that I
cut to loosen the one which I wish to extract.
Since this my attention has been directed to the article of Dr. Goddard
above mentioned. On reading it, I could not but feel surprised at the re-
sult of Dr. G.'s researches, if he was at all acquainted previously with
the minute anatomy of the parts under consideration, and with the
situation of the teeth in the different stages of their formation and de-
velopment. And since Dr. G. thinks he has discovered the ligament, I
am sorry he did not think his communication worthy of a plate which

would in some degree serve as an illustration, rather than send it out
with a diminutive wood engraving, perfectly indefinite in its delineation
in the points which should relate to his discovery.
On the ground of a long and intimate acquaintance with the anatomy
of the teeth, and of recent examinations of them with a view to furnish
the remarks which I am now about to make for your Journal, I am pre-
pared to say, that there is nothing about the teeth, their bony sockets and
surrounding gum, which deserves the name of ligament. That there is
no part of the soft structure which surrounds the teeth above the edges of
the alveoli (call it by what name you will,) which serves to confine them
in any remarkable manner in the jaw, or which prevents, in any percepti-
ble degree, their being detached from their firm articulation with the sock-
ets, in the case of an attempt to extract them. That this firm articu-
lation of a tooth with its socket, and the corresponding resistance
which is presented when we endeavor to dislocate it, depend, there-
fore, entirely on the intimate connection of the fang with the socket,
by means of a strong intervening membrane, commonly called perioste-
um, on the form of the fang and socket, and on the thickness and density of
the bony sides of the socket. And the part which is introduced as the
neio ligament, is nothing more than that portion of the gum which covers
the transverse processes of the alveoli, united with the fibres of the peri-
osteum above mentioned, and those of the partially absorbed capsular
membrane which envelopes the crown of the tooth during its formation,
and until it passes through the gum, all of which are united in a line about
the neck of the tooth, immediately above the edge of the socket, And
this is no more than has been known for a century at least, and may be
learned from the works of Hunter, Blake, Bourdet, Fox, Thos. Bell, A.
Serres, and many others.
There is, indeed, in some of the domestic animals, as the cow, sheep,
hog, &c., much less of the appearance of bone about the sockets of the
fro7it teeth, than is found about those of man, the sockets of the former be-
ing composed more of a texture resembling a tough cartilage; yet in these
the fangs of the teeth are secured entirely by the intervention of the same
fibrous membrane?the periosteum.
Between the human teeth, in the mature state of either the infant or
adult set, there is not room for the attachment of any ligamentous struc-
ture of sufficient magnitude or power to be of any importance in securing
the teeth in their sockets, as may be seen by examining the jaw at the
age of three years, or of twenty-five years. And all that can be found in
the place said to be occupied by the 7iew ligament, can be as clearly de-
monstrated to belong to one tooth as to the other, yet more justly to both;
and in proportion to the thickness of the gum, as much ligament can be
shown on the sides of the teeth which correspond to the outer or inner arch
of the jaw, as on the sides which are in apposition, notwithstanding we
are informed that the newly discovered ligament is situated only between the
teeth, and is attached to but One side?the back?of the next tooth. In a
word, the dental ligament has been brought up by a change of name, in-
stead of a real discovery of any new part, organ or texture.
But further?admitting it to exist?you would ask, what is its practical
bearing in the operation of extracting the teeth ] From a full and fair
examination on this point, by numerous operations, I am ready to answer,
that there is no perceptible difference in the looseness of a tooth, after all
AMERICAN JOURNAL 21
the soft parts have been thoroughly severed from it, be they ligament or
what you please, and before the knife or lancet has touched them ; provi-
ded the bony socket and membrane are in a perfect state, or under that de-
gree of inflammation only in which they are found previous to ulceration.
If, indeed, the surrounding bone is nearly or entirely absorbed, the gum
and periosteum of the fangs much inflamed and thickened, as is some-
times the case when, through fear of an operation, the patient has kept a
diseased tooth for months or years, the division of these soft parts will re-
move all obstruction, and the tooth may be lifted away with the thumb and
finger. But these cases are not very common, and have nothing to do with
our question.
With regard to the pain produced in the different modes of operating,
any man who is in the daily practice of extracting teeth may very soon
satisfy himself that cutting round them, as a general practice, is merely
inflicting needless suffering ; for the use of the most improved forceps,
without cutting at all, will give less pain, and the tooth is thus removed
by one operation instead of two, with perfect safety and more despatch.
The forceps are now in very general use, and when they are accurately
made to fit the teeth, and skilfully applied, they give so much less pain
than the German key in any of its varied forms, that there is no longer
any reasonable apology for the dentist who does not abandon the use of
this instrument entirely. In the dexterous use of the forceps, therefore,
I conceive, if in anything consists the excellence of Mr. Caldwell's opera-
tions, and not in his peculiar " tact in severing the ligament," as is sup-
posed by his friend, Dr. Goddard. And I have no doubt that if Mr. C.
will lay aside his lancet, and defy the strength of the ligament, he will
give more satisfaction and less suffering to his patients than he now does.
I beg your patience while I state a few brief questions, and I will trou-
ble you no longer on this matter.
If there is a ligament of such strength and importance confining the
teeth in the manner which the discoverers would represent, why does a
tooth require the same apparent effort to dislocate it, after all the soft parts
connected with it have been severed to the bone, as it would before this
had been done 1
To what is the ligament attached when the edge of the alveolus is ab-
sorbed, removing thereby the point of its origin, and leaving the neck of
the tooth?the part into which we are told it is so strongly inserted?
standing denuded the eighth of an inch or more above the gum.
And why does this tooth stand firm under such circumstances, and
require about as much force to remove it, and give as much pain in
the operation, as if the bone and the new ligament were in their natural
and perfect state, but because it is wholly supported and retained by the
strong articular membrane?the periosteum of the fang and its socket 1
When a tooth has been fractured or has decayed below the edge of the
eocket, why is it as firmly retained as when its crown and neck were per-
fect ? There is no ligament here. Why does it give as much pain to
extract it as if it were whole ] The ligament in this case has been severed.
What holds the fang of a tooth so firmly to a portion of the outer plate
of the socket, which has been drawn away with it by the use of the old
key-instrument. Is it the ligament 1 No, that has not been discovered
on this side of the tooth?yet the adhesion of these parts is so great that it
will commonly require the aid of some steel instrument to separate them.
22 DENTAL SCIENCE.
If the firmness with which the teeth are fixed to the jaw does not de-
pend, as I have already stated, on the thickness and density of the bone,
the form of the fang and socket, and the intimate attachment of the articu-
lar membrane; how does it happen, when this membrane becomes in-
flamed and thickened, and its vascular tissue weakened, that the tooth is
loosened and lifted somewhat from its berth, and may be extracted with
much less force than when the parts were in a healthy state ] And why
is it found, as this disease increases and the union between the periosteum
and fang is, perhaps, partially destroyed, that the tooth is nearly ready to
drop out, or may be taken away with the slightest effort ] The ligament
is not destroyed. It has hardly begun to share in the disease of the parts ;
for every practitioner in dentistry, of any observation, knows that the in-
flammation of the periosteum commences at the extiemity of the fang and
extends towards the crown of the tooth.
These are questions, involving truths, the kno wledge of which every den-
tist of much experience must possess. Perhaps the discoverers of the
new ligament can solve them. Yours, &c.
