CLEANLINESS OF THE TEETH,
Its importance to their health and preservation, and the means necessary
to its accomplishment.
? [ BY C. A. HARRIS, M. D. ]
The importance of a proper attention to the cleanliness of the teeth, is
to the profession too well known to need comment; the remarks, there-
fore, which we design making upon the subject, will be intended more for
the benefit of the general reader, than for that of the practitioner of dentis-
try ; and to him it would seem almost superfluous to speak particularly,
were we not apprized of the great diversity of opinion that exists among
those who have never made the diseases of these organs a matter of much
enquiry. By the educated and refined, its utility is pretty generally ac-
knowledged; yet there are a few, even among this description of persons,
who regard it as decidedly injurious, and as an evidence of the correctness
of their views, we are referred tu individuals fifty, sixty, or perhaps even
seventy or eighty years of age, whose teeth are perfectly sound, that have
never paid any attention to their cleanliness ; and to others, not more than
eighteen or twenty, that were known to be frequent and regular in its
observance, with deplorably bad ones. To a person unacquainted with
the differences in the liability of the teeth of different individuals to be-
come diseased and the causes that produce them, this might seem to be a
"very conclusive argument; but to one having a knowledge of them, it only
2

proves, that in proportion as these organs are hard or soft; that their pow-*
er or capability of resisting morbid impressions is increased or diminish-
ed. Hence, teeth, that are very hard, rarely decay; whereas, those that
are soft decay from the most trivial causes ; and thus it is, that some oc-
casionally retain them to an advanced period of life, while others, and
that too, very frequently, lose them before they arrive at any thing like
what is usually denominated middle age.
It often happens, however, that persons who are possessed of the hard-
est kind of teeth, lose them early in life by the destruction of the means
of their support; and it is worthy of remark, that the loss of the teeth
in this way is generally confined to those who pay little or no attention to
their cleanliness. With those who are, and have been from early child-
hood, in the frequent and regular observance of this, such an occurrence
rarely if ever happens ; and the reason is obvious :?By cleaning the teeth
regularly, two or three times a day, the formation of tartar is not only pre-
vented, but such particles of food and other extraneous matter as lodge
about and adhere to them, and which, when permitted to remain, soon be-
come putrid, vitiating the juices of the mouth, and causing them to irritate
and inflame the gums, and in consequence, to be absorbed, together with
the alveoli, are also removed. That there is a greater tendency in some
than others to disease of the gums, we do not deny; but this, by proper
care and attention might, we believe, in almost every instance, be coun-
teracted. Our opinion, therefore, is, that the gums, if the teeth be kept
perfectly clean, seldom become spongy or recede from their necks ; and
that teeth, that are situated in healthy gums, rarely, if ever, loosen much
in their sockets.
If this, then, be true?and that it is we are firmly pursuaded?the im-
portance of a strict observance of the purifying of the mouth, cannot, if
for no other purpose than the keeping of the gums healthy, and the pre-
vention of a consequent loosening of the teeth, be too strongly urged.
As a prophylactic against diseases of the teeth themselves, or at
least of their crowns, it is also powerful?we might, perhaps, say cer-
tain ?for, were it possible to keep them perfectly clean, we believe they
would never decay. But this, literally speaking, is hardly practicable.
The enamel on the sides of the teeth that come in contact with each
other, is often fractured, and within these fractures, and the indenta-
tions on the grinding surfaces of the bicuspides and molares, a lodg
ment is afforded to small particles of extraneous matter, and the secre-
tions of the mouth that cannot, by any of the ordinary purifying means,
be reached, and thereby remaining there until vitiated and putrid, exer-
cise upon the parts with which they are in contact, an exceedingly hurtful
influence. But were it carried as far as it is practicable, the teeth would
be much less frequently affected with disease ; in fact, we do not believe
there would be more than one decayed tooth, where there are now half a
dozen ; and in this opinion we are convinced, that every one whose atten-
tion has been much directed to the subject, will fully concur. It is one
to which we have paid much attention ; and the result of our observa-
tions is, that those who do, and have from early youth attended to the
cleaning of their teeth frequently, regularly and thoroughly, have alto-
gether and by far better ones than those who have neglected it, or who,
if they have attended to it at all, have done it at irregular and uncertain
intervals. This we have noticed in families, and in those parts where
DENTAL SCIENCE, tl
%ke members resembled each other in features, constitutional temper-
ament, and in the shape, size, colour and arrangement of their teeth,
and our enquiries in almost every; instanca, have tended to the con-
firmation of this opinion. Nor could it be otherwise ; for upon the pre-
sence of putrid foreign matter and vitiated mucus and saliva, c(oe? most
of the diseases of these organs depend.
The fact, then, that cleanlines of the teeth is essential to their health
and preservation being established, a motive sufficiently strong for its ob-
servance is no longer wanting. But were this not the case, others, though
comparatively of much less weight?but which with many may have a
greater influence?might be urged. Of these, the principal and only ones
which we at this time propose to notice, are personal appearance and
comfort, and upon them we shall offer but a few remarks.
To a pleasing and agreeable expression of the countenance, a clean
and healthy denture is of the greatest consequence. Even if the teeth
lack that perfect regularity of arrangement which it is desirable that they
should have, if they be but free from tartar, viscid mucus and extraneous
matter, their appearance will never be disagreeable ; but if any of them,
and more especially those occupying the anterior part of the mouth, be
discolonred or covered with clammy mucus or tartar, or any other kind
of foreign matter, they will rarely fail, however perfect all the other fea-
tures of the face may be, to give to the countenance an unpleasing
aspect,
^ However scrupulously particular persons of either sex may be in re-
gard to their dress, and although they may be decked with jewels, and
sparkle with diamonds, if they at the same time be unmindful of a proper
attention to the cleanliness of their teeth, they will fail to excite in indi-
viduals of refined taste, those feelings of admiration which most desire to
elicit, and which these organs when the requisite care has been bestowed
upon them always attract.
And as essential as this is to personal appearance, it is equally so to
comfort; and this of itself ought to be a sufficient inducement to the reg-
ular observance of such means as are necessary to its accomplishment;
but so remiss are some persons in regard to it, that they allow their teeth
to be constantly covered with putrid extraneous matter, and their breath,
in consequence, to be so offensive as to render their proximity to another
a source of the greatest annoyance. The frequent and thorough cleaning
of these organs is of the greatest consequence to a pure breath, and
those who neglect it, breathe a more or less contaminated air, which,
although it may not be obvious to themselves, is very perceptible to oth-
ers. It is also requisite to health, for in proportion as the teeth are un-
clean, especially those of persons who have delicate constitutions, is the
appetite impaired and the digestive organs weakened ; and thus the capa-
bility of enjoying life is often greatly diminished. But to enter into ah
explanation of the manner in which the health of the general system be-
comes affected by the want of a proper attention to the teeth, constitutes
no part of our present purpose ; it may, however, from what has been said
in regard to its effects upon the organs themselves, and upon the gums
and alveolar processes, be very readily inferred.
Having now shown the importance to the health and preservation of
the teeth, of keeping them constantly clean, we shall proceed to describe
the manner by which it is to be effected, premising, that if they or the parts
12 AMERICAN JOURNAL
within which they are contained, be diseased, such means as are nercessaf-
ry to their restoration to health, should first be resorted t.o This done,
all that will usually be required to keep them clean, will be a tooth-pick,
a brush, and pure water. The first of these should be constructed from a
goose-quill, and should always be used immediately after eating, that such
particles of food as may have gotten between the teeth, may be removed
before they shall have undergone a chemical change, As it regards the
kind of brush most proper to be employed, there exists a considerable di-
versity of opinion ; some prefer a very hard one, others think a brush can>
not be too soft; whilst others again, give their preference to a medium one,
and to this last our own is decidedly inclined. A toothbrush should be
neither too hard nor too soft, but of these qualities the last is least objec-
tionable, and for a child is perhaps preferable to any other. The bristles
should be about one half of an inch in length, and be elastic, so that they
may be made to reach and act upon all the inequalities of the teeth, and
with such a brush as this, and water, they should be thoroughly rubbed
several times a day : say, for instance, in the morning immediately after
getting up, and after every meal. This purifying process should be com-
menced in early childhood, and if it be carried to a sufficient extent, it
will prevent the teeth from becoming stained or discoloured, and keep the
gums healthy.
Dentifrices, such as powders, lotion, &c. are only called for in the treat-
ment of diseased teeth and gums, therefore, of them we shall say nothing:
at present.
