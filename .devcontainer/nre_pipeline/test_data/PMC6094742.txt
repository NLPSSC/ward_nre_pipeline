DENTAL SCIENCE.
REVIEW,
BY SOLYMAN BROWN.
" The Dental Art, a practical treatise on Dental Surgery, by Chapin A.
Harris, M. D., Surgeon Dentist."?Baltimore?Armstrong & Berry, 1839,
338 pp. Octavo. ^ .
The members of the profession, and students in particular, have long
felt the necessity of a treatise on Dentistry in all its branches, medical,
surgical and mechanical, which should at once be comprehensive in its
scope, practical in its detail, correct in its science, and beautiful in its
typographical execution. This desideratum is now supplied in a manner
highly creditable to the accomplished author, and peculiarly acceptable to
the profession at large. No dental work of exactly a similar character has
ever been issued by the American press, and thence it comes in competition
with the work of no living author on this side of the Atlanti?.. In compari-
son with English and French publications on the same subject, it can suffer
nothing, and indeed possesses one advantage, inasmuch as it brings down
the history and knowledge of our art to the present day, with all the im-
provements which the genius of American practitioners has introduced
into their favorite science.
Dr. Harris has proved himself so well qualified for his task, that it may
be safely asserted, that no one volume in the English language cantains an
equal amount of correct and valuable information'for the use of the student
in dentistry; and indeed the pupil would be compelled to ransack many
volumes in different languages to arrive at all the valuable truths comprised
in this work. There are manifested also in Dr. Harris' volume, an origi-
nality of thought, and an independence of opinion equally calculated to
elicit truth and expose error.
But there is still another point of view in which this treatise should be
regarded, by all who are either operators or subjects of dental practice.
It is this :?The author has so well acquitted himself, that his work is cal-
culated to give dignity and importance to the subject of which it treats;
evincing that the writer is one of those high-minded men who impart re-
spectability to the calling which they pursue, rather than increase their
own importance by its exercise.
The time has come when the Medical Faculty, and the most discerning
members of society at large, are beginning to rank the profession of the
Dentist with those other avocations of men, which are honourable be-
cause they are useful, and profitable, because their exercise demands pe-
culiar qualifications to ensure success.
In all professions, there will be found those who presume upon abilities
which others never discover, and wonder that fortune does not smile upon
their presumption. But the period is not far distant, when it will be learn-
ed, as well by the profession as by its patrons, that if there are any arts of
civilized society which require for their exercise, education, genius, moral
integrity, solid judgment, scientific discrimination, and mechanical skill,
the Art of Dentistry stands pre-eminent among the number.
Who would willingly permit a stupid bungler, ignorant alike of his own
business and of every thing else, to operate upon the delicate and sensitive
organs of the mouth 1 Whatever qualifications other callings may require,
most assuredly, the offices of the Dental Operator should be performed by

a gentleman in manners, an artist in skill, a man of tender sensibility and
refined decorum.
It is surely no flattering compliment, either to the profession which we
follow, or to the community which requires its services, that in many in-
stances, those who have been openly disgraced by notorious criminality,
are still the objects of public favour. For the correction of this, and many
other evils, publications like that under review, are eminently designed.
Dentistry, with its present improvements, is anew science, and it requires
writers of education and genius to give it consistency and reputation.
This work contains no irrelevant matter; every page is filled with useful
and interesting information; so that the student will find it a text-book
exactly suited to his wants, while the general reader, or the educated den-
tist, without meeting with any thing to offend his taste, will find something
to increase his knowledge.
The following extracts will furnish the reader with a specimen of the
author's style; but we trust that every member of the profession will avail
himself, without delay, of the entire work.
ABUSES OP DFNTISTRY.
" Confided, as this branch of surgery always has been, in almost every
country, to the hands of whoever seemed disposed to attempt the exer-
cise of its intricate duties, it is not to be wondered, that it should have
frequently fallen into obloquy and disrepute. But how much soever it
may have suffered from this cause, its utility is not the less great, and
we can only regret that public opinion has not been sufficiently awaken-
ed to its importance to defend it from the impositions of pretending
empirics.
It is a remarkable and humiliating fact, that though dental surgery wai
never better understood, yet its principles were never more erroneously
practiced and shamefully abused than at the present day. It may now be
said to have attained its greatest perfection ; but while there are many
that have carefully studied its principles, and devoted themselves with
zeal and integrity to its practice, there are others, actuated by less praise-
worthy motives, that have attempted to discharge its duties without pos-
sessing any of the necessary preparatory qualifications, and in conse-
quence, many injuries have resulted from their operations."
The author has the following remarks on the effects of Mercury:
" Mercury does not, as many imagine, exert any direct action on the
teeth; it is only by the effects that it sometimes produces in the gums
and the secretions of the mouth, that they are injured by its use. When
it is given in sufficient quantities, and long enough to produce ptyalism,
however slight, it becomes hurtful to the teeth, and just in proportion as
it affects the juices of the mouth, are the corrosive properties of these
fluids increased. Hence, it can be considered only as an indirect cause in
the production of caries.
The relation which the teeth sustaix*. tn the maxillae, however, is often
very seriously affected, and sometimes t irirely destroyed, by the exhibi-
tion of this medicine. Its introdu^tteft^nto the system is generally follow-

ed by an increased action of the absorbents, and in no part of the body is
this more evident than in the gums and alveolar processes. It sometimes
occasions a very rapid loss of substance in these parts, so that the teeth,
by the absorption of their sockets, are loosened, and, in a few months,
caused to drop out. A few years ago, an application was made to me, for
a set of artificial teeth and gums, by an interesting young lady, of only
twenty years of age, who had lost nearly the whole of her teeth, by the
absorption of her gums and alveolar processes. She informed me, that
about four years before, she had been afflicted with a severe attack of
bilious fever, and during its continuance, had taken a great deal of mer-
cury, and, in consequence, had been so badly salivated, that her teeth
were loosened, and soon after her recovery, dropped out one after another,
in spite of the efforts of several physicians and dentists to preserve them,
until only nine remained.
The deposition of tartar upon the teeth, is much increased by the use!
of this medicine, especially when it affects the saliva. So much, in fact,
is the tendency to a deposition of this substance increased by its exhibi-
tion, that persons laboring, for the first time, under a mercurial diathesis,
frequently have the crowns of their teeth, opposite the mouths of the sali-
vary ducts, completely coated with it in a few days."
Remarks while treating of Mechanical operations.
" Many have chosen dentistry as a profession, with the belief that a
knowledge of it was more easily acquired, than that of any other; and
some, after having followed it for two or three years, and finding that in
order to attain respectability and usefulness in it, greater difficulties were
to be surmounted than they had anticipated, have preferred to abandon it
altogether, rather than bring disgrace upon both it and themselves. Let
no one, therefore, be deceived into a belief, that, in a few weeks or months,
he can become master of the art; for, should he commence its study
under such an impression, he will most assuredly be disappointed, and,
perhaps, find, after having devoted to it what he before thought sufficient
tims for its entire acquisition, that he has scarcely attained to a knowledge
of its elementary principles."
