GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

perfection, and the light of pathological research now lends its aid to
practitioners, in the most complicated diseases; Dentistry by no means

keeps pace with these improvements. It does not receive that attention
from public schools, which its importance demands; and although we
have many works, ex-professo, on the structure and diseases of the teeth,
yet many more are still to be desired. Authors on Nosology and Physiolo-
gy usually confine themselves to some particular department of medicine,
and discuss in but a very superficial manner, all other subjects, which for
the completion of their works they are compelled to notice. Many of
them, indeed, though fully confessing the great want of knowledge that
exists, of the expansion, growth and affections of the teeth, are neverthe-
less, unable, by reason of their numerous engagements, to devote them
selves to this study.
These bones, indeed, were formerly regarded merely as ornaments of
the face, and accordingly their preservation was rather the province of
the perfumer than of the regular physician.
But modern physiologists, in lecturing on the phenomena of digestion,
have now very clearly shown, in what manner the teeth are necessary for
the performance of one of those functions on which life depends. It is
now well known that the alimentary canal is charged with those substan-
ces designed for growth and preservation of the individual, and it must
be aided in its operations by mechanical means. Man's stomach cannot
act with ease, unless the destined aliment has first passed through a pre-
vious preparation. Accordingly, our food is first roasted or boiled and
seasoned in various ways before it is committed to the mouth, in order
that it may the better be prepared to be submitted to the action of the
stomach, by its being penetrated with saliva, the secretion of which is
called forth by the presence of the food, and by mastication. But how
can this last be performed with jaws unfurnished with teeth ]
In those animals which have a membranous stomach, the teeth are de-
signed as auxiliaries to facilitate its operations ; and, as it has pleased the
Creator to use an endless variety of means to produce the same results,
those species, whose stomachs are of a weak texture, are supplied with
teeth, while those which possess this organ endowed with great muscular
power are unfurnished with them.
The stomach in animals of the ruminating kind, whose dental arch is
incomplete, generally supplies the want of these bones, and the food is
brought again to the mouth, there to be masticated anew and to be sub-
mitted again to insalivation.
The physicians of our day, better appreciate the importance of Den-
tistry than those of a former age; they recommend it to our attention,?
they do not neglect to examine the habitual healthy state of the mouth,
and hence, they frequently make inductions which are useful to them in
cases of disease.*
The phenomena exhibited in the development of these small bones,
which now engage our notice, have attracted the attention of some, and
its contents. A treatise on tins part of the scicnce, has long been needed in our own
language ; and with a view of supplying this want, the tian.slator conte.nplatcs pre-
senting in a short time, the whole work to the American public, accompjnied with
numerous notes and an introduction. h*rkis.

are a certain number of important symptoms connected with the jaws, the saliva,
the tartar, &c. which have not yet been mentioned.

excited their curiosity; but, to speak freely, this part of the science is
still too much neglected and too little understood,?it demands a less su-
perficial study, from those who devote themselves to the honourable
task of instructing their pupils in all the branches of the great medi-
cal art.
Although there have been a great many very interesting works on
First Dentition, still all the phenomena of which it is composed, have
not yet been fully enumerated; it is for time and experience to supply
these deficiencies.?Happy will he be who shall diminish their number*
First Dentition, however, has been under the inspection of men of
approved medical knowledge; it is not thus with the branch we are
now considering ;?it has been left to the observation and sagacity of
Dentists, possessing none of the knowledge which is to be found only in
physiology.
The laws that govern the expansion, growth and arrangement of the
teeth, are properly the patrimony of the physician, who should under-
stand those, in order to direct the dentist whenever (as is sometimes un-
fortunately the case,) he is not furnished with sufficient information on all
the duties of his profession.
It is very desirable that there should be a class of physicians, who
give their attention to the practice for diseases of the mouth; this is
the only means of preventing so important a part of our art from falling
into the unskilful hands of mere practitioners, or from becoming the prey
of the vilest charlatans. Such persons cannot practice surgery without
detriment to society.
He that is nothing more than a mechanician, ought not to be admitted
into the sanctuary of Esculapius. His duty here, should be confined to
the management of those machines, with which alone he has the right to
interfere.!
I repeat it, the knowledge of true Dentistry is not sufficiently diffused,
and never will be, until it shall have been made as much a portion of
public instruction, as the various other parts of the art; then, and then
only will it be cultivated by educated men, and advance with the same
vigour as the other branches of medicine.
The management of Second Dentition, is a stumbling-block to Dentists
of moderate abilities ; they have for this, a certain routine, which, I say
it with regret, is sustained by writings of authority with those who find
in these books of ready made opinions, food for their minds, and founda-
tion for their practice, without giving themselves the trouble to estimate
their value.
It is in order to eradicate these errors, that I have determined to pub-
* The work of Professor Beaumes, on First Dentition, should, nevertheless, be well
studied : it is justly placed in ihe first rank.
II have not room here to express my regret, that goldsmiths, jewellers, watch-ma-
kers and workers in ivory, having laboured only as such in the laboratories of dentists,
without having studied, without ever assisting at their operations, should obtain per-
mission to practice. Let us however, hope, that under the wise regulations that are
proposed for the practice of medicine, these sorts of admissions will no longer occur ;
and that with these, will also disappear those great teeth of varnished ivory that indi-
cate the abodes of these dentists, and which to the shame of the art, are also seen at
the doors of some more respectable personages.

lish this work. It is not my intention to establish any new system; the
natural method which I here explain has been followed by many distin-
guished Dentists ; but they have either not made public the results of
their experience, or have done it in a brief manner. I here show that
which enlightened men practice daily with success ; and I only add some
few reflections, drawn from my practice, and from an anatomical exami-
nation of the jaw, considered from the first moment that the adult teeth
appear, until the period they take their place in that circle, which, after
their growth they are destined to occupy. Thus submitting my observa-
tions to the just criticism of professional men, I leave it to their abilities
to decide upon a subject of so much importance as to interest every class
of the community.
Among the numerous authors, both native and foreign, that I have been
obliged to consult before writing,* I have not found any who do not
seemingly present some system founded on their own personal observa-
tion; they abandon themselves to reasonings more or less specious, and
forsake the paths of experience to follow the vagaries of their imagina-
tions. Others do not fully explain themselves on this point; they elude
and seem afraid to grapple with the subject.
Sprengel has justly remarked, that the road of experience is very diffi-
cult to travel, for it is easier to follow the suggestions of fancy, and by an
unvaried routine, to acquire a certain amount of skill, than to confine
one's self to the narrow and thorny path of observation.
These principles may be applied to the treatment of Second Dentition;
it is much easier to extract the teeth, than to determine whether this is ab-
solutely necessary. The extraction of a tooth requires nothing more on
the part of the practitioner, than a certain degree of facility in the use of
the instruments that are usually employed in this operation; whilst the
knowledge necessary to appreciate the consequence, can only be acquired
by time and study.
Fauchard, Jourdain, Bourdet and other writers of a more modern date,
have treated this point with a sort of indifference, unfortunate for the pro-
fession, and painful to him who expects to find in the works of these
learned Dentists, something which at least will instruct him.
In his jDentiste de la Jeunesse, so finely written, M. Duval has shown
great literary talents ; but this work seems rather to be designed for the
public at large than for men of the profession. The author, believing that
his professional brethren were as learned as he, has not taught them pre-
cisely what he should have known so well how to teach; he has not men-
tioned how very necessary it is in order to assist Dentition, that the means
should be varied according to circumstances.
In another work, excellent in many respects, he has not reckoned
among the dangers of extraction, the imperfect configuration of the Den-
tal Arch and the destruction of the germs of adult teeth, the common re-
sult of an improper extraction, and which a practitioner of his merit
could not have failed to observe."
* I have employed some moments of leisure to translate the works of Hunter and
Fox upon the human teeth. My intention at first, was to publish them : but I have
found in them so many opinions, and so many things which do not accord with our
actual knowledge of physiology, that I regard them only as good sources from which
we may derive information, but whose engravings constitute their greatest merit.
14 DENTAL SCIENCE.
We do not wish to be considered as coinciding with M. Delabarre in
all his views, though on the whole, we regard his Treatise on Second Den-
tition, as decidedly the best that has ever been published. He has, it is
true, in many places, while attempting to point out errors in others, fallen
into very palpable ones himself, which, should we, as it is our intention
soon to do, ever publish the whole work, we propose to notice. He has,
as must be acknowledged by every one acquainted with his work,
discussed the subject on which it treats, in a very able and masterly
manner.
The general principles laid down by Fox, for the treatment of Second
Dentition, evince a thorough knowledge of the subject, and have consti-
tuted the basis of the established practice ever since, but he did not enter
sufficiently into detail. There are many things connected with this sub-
ject, which are necessary for the practitioner to understand, unnoticed by
him. Upon these M. Delabarre has treated at large.
