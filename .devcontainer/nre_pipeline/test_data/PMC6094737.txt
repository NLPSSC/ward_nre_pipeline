THE AMERICAN JOURNAL
OF
DENTA L SCIENCE.
ADDRESS
OF THE PUBLISHING COMMITTEE, TO THEIR PROFESSIONAL BRETHREN
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
GENTLEMEN :
The period has at length arrived, when the profession to which
we belong assumes a commanding position in the public eye, and challenges
successful rivalship with the other useful and profitable avocations of men.
This fact is not less auspicious to society at large, than to the professors of
Dental Science, and the practitioners of the Dental Art.
Even the Members of the Medical Profession, so proverbial for their re-
luctance to encourage innovations in the healing art, are beginning to dis-
cover the importance of our co-operation in mitigating the woes, and pro-
tracting the duration of human existence. The achievement of this object
is to be ascribed to the noble spirit of virtuous enterprise with which the
present age is inspired, and which we see displayed in every department
of human industry and skill. If this spirit is sometimes developed in ex-
cess, as when the splendid steam-vessel, ploughing in majesty the billows
of the ocean, is followed by the stupid steam-doctor, digging the graves of
his victims on the land, it is nevertheless, the consecrated agency by which
the destinies of the world are to be gloriously accomplished, and which
already has so far transformed the aspect of society, that, could the man
who has slept for the last half century, be awakened from his slumbers,
he would hardly recognize the world in which we live, as the place of his
original abode.
4 DENTAL SCIENCE.
These magnificent results, to appreciate which the man of the present
day must traverse oceans by the energies of fire, and fly over plains and
mountains on the wings of the wind, are the products of human industry,
goaded by a restless enterprize, and guided by resistless genius.
Whether this industry, enterprize and genius, are peculiar to the pre-
sent age, or whether the existing condition of the Sciences and Arts is the
ultimate result of a series of predisposing causes, which have been operating
for ages past, is matter of little moment. It is quite sufficient for our hap-
piness and mutual congratulation, to know that we live in an age of unpa-
rallelled improvement in all that can result from the energies of intellect
acting upon material nature, or from the re-action of matter upon the hu-
man mind.
In this condition of civilized man, and of all those Aits and Sciences
which embellish life, imparting to it augmented zest and increased dura-
tion, it is our happiness to know that neither the theory, nor the practice
of the Dental Art, has been left behind the age, either by the incompeten-
cy or inactivity of those individuals to whom, in the progress of events, its
destiny has been intrusted. If there be any class of men in these States
who have "compassed sea and land," in pursuit of usefulness, fame and
fortune, braving obloquy, and resisting opposition, enduring fatigue, and
despising danger, there are surely many among our professional collabora-
tors who stand in the foremost rank of these benevolent adventurers. Nor
have they exerted themselves in vain. Ample fortune and enviable celeb-
rity, have already rewarded the spirited zeal of many labourers in this
wide field of professional enterprise ; while the improved condition of our
Art, as regards its salutary influence on society at large, is a proof of the
justice of the desert which has been thus munificently rewarded.
What encouragement, then, is this, to increased exertion in this field
of useful labour, and honorable distinction ! Who would not prefer
to attend these distinguished pioneers in the paths of Dental Science, and
share their rewards, rather than follow the Caesars and Napoleons of past
ages to their fields of blood, and their untimely graves ]
Presuming that many of those individuals, to whose professional inter-
ests this work will be devoted, must feel as we do on the subject of eleva-
ting the Dental Science to its deserved position among the callings of
men,?and feeling confident that where much has been already done, still
more remains yet to be effected, the Publishing Committee have issued
this specimen number of a Monthly Periodical, dedicated to the profession
at large, with a perfect conviction of the obvious truth, that by their prompt
encouragement or silent neglect, it must either stand or fall. That any
other class of our fellow citizens, excepting, perhaps, an inconsiderable
AMERICAN JOURNAL 6
portion of the medical profession, will afford the least encouragement to
the present undertaking, is beyond our hope. The details of Dental
Practice, and even the more sulferable theory of our Art, possess an ab-
sorbing interest chiefly with the more intelligent and ambitious of our own
profession ; and it is to them therefore, that we now appeal, by first pre-
senting an expose of our general plan, and then suggesting a few brief
considerations to induce our professional brethren to co-operate in our
design.
