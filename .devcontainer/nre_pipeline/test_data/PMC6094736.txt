REMARKABLE CASE OF OSSEOUS UNION OF THE TEETH.
By Eleazar Parmly.
A lad about eight years of age, was brought to me by his parents, whose
mouth presented the most singular appearance that I had ever witnessed.
The incisors were all through the gum, and about one half of the crown of
each tooth could be distinctly seen ; but they were so irregular in their
arrangement, and so remarkable in their form, as to render the mouth so
unlike that of other children of the same age, that no person seeing
merely an impression or cast of the mouth, would imagine it to belong to
a human being. The superior front and lateral incisors were completely
and perfectly united both in their enamel and bony structure ; the poste-
rior surface showing two distinct teeth, while the anterior presented one
smooth and polished surface, excepting at the cutting edge, where there
was a slight division. These teeth were as large, and occupied as much
space as the four front incisors generally do in the male subject. They
were very prominent, and behind them were two other teeth in form and
size resembling the lateral incisors.
In order to remedy this ill shapen and unnatural formation and growth,
I proposed to the parents to remove the two central incisors, together, of
course, with the laterals attached to them, and then by mechanical pres-

sure, to bring the two supernumerary teeth together which stood behind
them ; and also, bring forward the cuspidati in proper time so as to make a
tolerably even arrangement.
I frequently see the young gentleman, whose permanent teeth have
now all come in with the exception of the wisdom teeth, and stand in the
following order: The two supernumerary teeth occupy the place of the
superior front incisors ; the cuspidati occupy the position of the lateral in-
cisors ; the first bicuspides, the place of the cuspidati, and so on, forming
a very pretty arrangement, and one that a casual observer would not no-
tice as differing essentially from other mouths.
I have a two fold object in laying a statement of this case before the
profession. The first is to convince parents that in all cases how great
soever the irregularity may be, teeth can, by proper care and skill, be
brought into systematic order. My second object is to settle a long con-
tested point, whether there does exist any well attested instance of osse-
ous union of the teeth.
Mr. Bell, in his excellent work on the Anatomy of the Teeth, asserts
the existence of such union, which is confidently denied by Mr. Koecker.
Mr. Bell, in his rejoinder, intimates that Mr. Koecker not only has seen,
but may again see, at Guy's Hospital, a perfect example of this kind.?
That the specimen which I have in my possession is incontestibly of the
same character, no person can doubt, who will take the trouble to in-
spect it.
I have extracted within the present month, two teeth, the crowns of
which were thus completely united.
