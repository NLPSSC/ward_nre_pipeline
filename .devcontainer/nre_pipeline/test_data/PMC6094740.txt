PROSPECTUS,
The plan of " The American Journal of Dental Science," may be
expressed in general terms, by saying,?That it is intended as a vehicle
of useful information to the numerous Operative Dentists in the United
States. That medical gentlemen will be its patrons to some extent, there
is little doubt; and that some general readers will become subscribers to
the work, and peruse it with interest and profit, we think is equally
certain.
The detail of Our plan maybe seen in the following particulars :
1. The Journal will consist of forty-eight octavo pages per number; j
twenty-four of which will be employed in re-publishing Standard Works
on Dental Theory and Practice ; ,as Jin the present number.
2. This Specimen Number is a sample of the entire Work as regards
the size and quality of the paper; the character of the typography, and
the general appearance of the Journal.
3. The re-published Works wiJl be so printed that the numbers may be
separated, and the two halves distinctly bound ; making two entire works
of which the re-publication will amount to at least a volume in each year,
worth of itself the whole subscription price of the magazine.
4. Each number will contain the Biography of some Dental Writer
or Practitioner, with Portraits in all cases in which they can be obtained.
5. Each number will contain a Review of some Dental Work, or
translation from foreign languages.
6. Each number will contain Communications from contributors, on
the various topics of useful discussion, relating to the physiology, patholo-
gy, preservation, restoration, and general management of the teeth, and
adjacent parts.
7. Curious Facts, and Dental Anecdotes, will give interest to the pa-
ges of the Journal.
8. The Arts of Quackery will be boldly exposed ; and the public will
be instructed how to avoid the impositions of ignorant pretenders.
9. Numerous wood cuts, and other prints, will embellish and illustrate
the work, as the state of the subscription will justify.
10. The Journal will be published simultaneously in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, New-York and Boston, on the first day of every month, to
commence as soon as the number of subscribers will permit.
11. Each and every Article admitted to the pages of this Journal,
will be accompanied by the name of its author.
12. All Letters and Packages must be post-paid.

13. Any individual who will remit to the Editors, Publishing Com'
mittee, or Treasurer, the sum of Five Dollars, shall receive two copies of
the Journal through twelve numbers.
14. The work will be Edited by Chapin A. Harris of Baltimore,
and Eleazar Parmly of New-York.
15. The Publishing Committee are E. Parmly, E. Baker, and S.
Brown, of New-York.
16. Mr. Jahial Parmly of New-York, is the Treasurer of the Associ-
ation, and will receive subscriptions by mail or otherwise.
17. Subscribers who desire that their numbers should be forwarded
otherwise than by mail, will please to give written instructions on the
subject.
18. lhe Journal will be mailed m the tour cities ot Philadelphia,
Baltimore, New-York, and Boston, for subscribers living near those cities
respectively.
19. A list of subscribers will be published in at least two numbers of
the Journal in each year, and to this end subscribers are requested to give
their names in full, with places of residence if stationary j or with the
places they annually visit, if migratory. Those residing in cities are re-
quested to give street and number.
20. Dentists who approve the objects of this Journal, and wish to
give it more decided encouragement than by becoming subscribers for
single copies, are requested to take several copies for private distribution;
and also to obtain subscribers to the Journal.
As motives to induce the members of the profession to subscribe libe-
rally for the work themselves, and to obtain subscriptions among their
medical friends and others of their acquaintances, the Publishing Com-
mittee take the liberty of suggesting the following propositions :
1. There is no fraternity in the United States, of equal magnitude and
importance, which has not some publication devoted to its interest.
2. The necessity of a general diffusion of knowledge in Dental Theo-
ry and Practice, if not felt by the profession, is at least deplored by the
public.
3. There are many high-minded men of great knowledge and experi-
ence in our Art, who will gladly communicate the results of their obser-
tion, for the benefit of the younger members of the profession.
4. Such a work will have a tendency to expel from Dental Practice,
the quackery which disgraces it, just in proportion as it dissipates igno-
rance on the subject from community at large.
5. It will give to distant parts of the country the benefit of all the
Theoretical and Practical knowledge, which exists in our large cities,
on the subject of operations on the teeth,
6. This publication will diffuse important kinds of information which
is now local and limited, for want of a medium of publication.
7. It will associate in fraternal feeling, many who will be benefitted by
the association.
8. This Journal will perpetuate those numerous Treatises on Dental
Science and Practice, which are now nearly out of print; as well Europe-
an as American.
9. If the members of the Profession, few in number compared with
the patrons of other periodicals, do not subscribe liberally to the work,
there is little probability that it can be long sustained*

10. The publication of such a Journal, will have the effect of giving
dignity and importance to the general subject of Practical Dentistry; and
thus result in solid advantage to each and all of its professors, as well as to
community at large.
11. The state of the subscription list will indicate the scene of opera-
tion of the principal Dentists in the United States, and thus inform that
portion of the profession who are not stationary in their labours, to what
points their exertions may be most profitably directed.
12. The publication of the entire list of Practitioners in the United
States, will have a tendency to check the exuberant influx of half educated
aspirants, who imagine that the field of labour is but partially occupied,
and thus expose themselves to ultimate disappointment.
In relation to the last of these propositions, it should be remarked, that
although the number of dental practitioners in the United States, whose
services are of any value to the public, is sufficiently limited, yet the per-
sons who could convince the community of their real interests on the sub-
ject of their teeth, and induce them to employ the profession, must be
differently educated from those whose abominable mal-practice has so
long disgraced the profession, and imposed upon mankind.
It is to remedy this state of things as well in the practices of the profes-
sion as in the opinion of community, that the present work is proposed to
be established?and we feel confident, that no Dental Operator who does
not find it for his interest to perpetuate the present state of things, will re-
fuse it his cordial support.
It was under the influence of this belief, that the Publishing Committee
have issued this specimen number of the work, which they intend to for-
ward by mail or otherwise, to every Dentist whose name and residence
they can obtain in the United States and British provinces of North Ameri-
ca. To enable them to effect this purpose, they solicit each and every in-
dividual in the profession, to forward to them, not only his own name and
residence, but the name and residence of every professional brother with
whom he may be acquainted in any state of the union. The letters should
be post paid, for the obvious reason, that the price of postage will not be
felt by the individual writer, but would be a burdensome item in the ac-
counts of the publishers.
With these remarks, we submit to our professional brethren the impor-
tant question, whether a dental magazine can be sustained in our country.
